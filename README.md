# ASFV_spatialomics_analysis
Spatial transcriptomic profiling of pig lung tissues before and after African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection reveals dynamic immune and molecular landscape changes between early and late infection stages.
## ðŸ§  ASFV Spatial Omics Analysis â€” Workflow Overview

This project provides a spatial omics analysis pipeline for pig lung and spleen tissues before and after **ASFV infection**.  
The workflow is organized into modular Jupyter notebooks as follows:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Image Data Decoding
**Notebook:** `decode_innereye.ipynb`  
Decodes raw spatial transcriptomics imaging data and extracts spatial gene expression matrices for downstream analysis.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Downstream Analysis & Visualization
**Notebook:** `downstream_analysis.ipynb`  
Performs data normalization, clustering, cell-type annotation, and integrated visualization of ASFV-infected and control samples.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Scatter Plot Visualization
**Notebook:** `scatterplot.ipynb`  
Generates customized scatter plots for spatial feature visualization and regional expression patterns.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Spleen Analysis
**Notebook:** `spleen_analysis.ipynb`  
Contains the complete workflow for analyzing ASFV-induced molecular and spatial alterations in spleen tissues.

---

ðŸ§© *Each notebook is designed to run independently while maintaining a consistent data structure across the workflow.*
